## Description:

This is a simple implementation of the Hangman game in Python. It allows two players to play against each other. Player 1 enters a word, and Player 2 attempts to guess the word by suggesting letters. Player 2 has a limited number of chances to guess the correct word.

## How to Play:

1. **Player 1 (Word Setter):**
    - Enter your name when prompted.
    - Enter the word you want Player 2 to guess.
    - Choose the number of chances (maximum 8) Player 2 will have.

2. **Player 2 (Guesser):**
    - Enter your name when prompted.
    - Guess letters to reveal the hidden word.
    - You have a limited number of chances to guess the word.

3. **Game Rules:**
    - Win the game by correctly guessing the word within the allowed chances.
    - The hangman figure will be drawn as you make incorrect guesses.
    - The game ends when Player 2 either correctly guesses the word or runs out of chances.

## How to Run:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.

```bash
python hangman.py
```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

Have fun playing Hangman!
